 * <P>To create a type-specific bidirectional iterator, besides what is needed
 * for an iterator you need both a method returning the previous element as
 * primitive type and a method returning the previous element as an
 * object. However, if you inherit from this class you need just one (anyone).
 *
 * <P>This class implements also a trivial version of {@link #back(int)} that
 * uses type-specific methods.
